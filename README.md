# jsonapi-resolvers

Build a resolving function to help you resolve JSON-API entities. With support for selecting specific `fields` & recursively `include`-ing related documents.

```js
const { createResolver } = require('jsonapi-resolvers');
// Or
import { createResolver } from 'jsonapi-resolvers';
```
